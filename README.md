# KartingFrenzyCup

This program simulates a go-kart game with four karts that complete a random number of laps on three different circuits: Magnicourt, Silverstone, and Monaco. Each lap is simulated by generating a random time for each kart and updating the total time for each kart. After each lap, the karts are ranked based on their total time and the result is displayed. At the end of the race, the karts are ranked on a podium based on their total time.
